Stuff I've done tonight:

Commented out the Anaconda line in ~/.bash_profile
https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/add-shell-path-osx/

Homebrew did not like anaconda (maybe) despite changing the $PATH
`conda install anaconda-clean`
`anaconda-clean`
https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install

Deleted the Python 3.3 I had from `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework`

Apparently OS X El Capitan ruins this which breaks brew among other things:
`xcode-select --install`
http://tips.tutorialhorizon.com/2015/10/01/xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path-library-developer-commandline-tools-missing-xcrun/

Just to clean out some seemingly useless stuff after `brew doctor`
`brew prune`

Finally, installed xpdf
`brew install homebrew/x11/xpdf`
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34771535/pdfinfo-package-for-mac-os-x
That post notes the mdls command which may prove useful as it picks up a few things 
(eg the source URL) that pdfinfo leaves out.
In general, I'm bummed my literature pdfs don't have more content and in 
particular are missing the DOIs mostly.
