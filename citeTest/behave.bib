...family CEOs devote 8 percent fewer hours than professional managers to their corporate responsibilities.

Young firms with substantial family ownership often wrestle with the choice between having a member of the family serve as CEO and recruiting an outsider, a professional manager, as the CEO. Are there differences in behavior between the two groups? In Managing the Family Firm: Evidence from CEOs at Work (NBER Working Paper No. 19722), Oriana Bandiera, Andrea Prat, and Raffaella Sadun suggest that on average, professional managers generate greater growth, productivity, and profits for the firm.

The authors study the work habits of 356 CEOs in the Indian manufacturing sector, where family ownership is common and productivity among firms varies markedly. They find that family CEOs devote 8 percent fewer hours than professional managers to their corporate responsibilities. Moreover, the researchers find that longer hours are associated with more successful firms and with higher levels of CEO pay.

To measure time use, the researchers reconstruct the CEOs' time diary via daily phone interviews with their personal assistants over the course of one week. They ask respondents to use their diaries to list sequentially all activities longer than 15 minutes, such as meetings, phone calls, and other tasks, the type and number of people involved, the location, and the duration of the activity. This allows the researchers to estimate how much time CEOs allocate to their duties and how they divide their time among different tasks. To gauge whether the findings are specific to the Indian context, they apply the same methodology to collect time use data in a range of other countries, including the United States, and they find similar differences between family CEOs and professional managers.

The study reveals that the average CEO in the sample spends 9 hours per day at work, with CEOs in the bottom quartile working an average of 6.9 hours per day and those in the top quartile working on average 10.7 hours per day. There is a strong positive correlation between the number of hours worked by the CEO, firm performance, and CEO remuneration.

To understand why some CEOs spend more hours at work than others do, the researchers develop measures of the "marginal cost of effort" using instances of extreme monsoon rainfall and the broadcasting of popular sporting events, in particular international Premier League cricket games, across days of the sample week. They find that the difference in hours worked between family CEOs and professional managers is significantly larger on days when torrential rains or cricket matches - which generate traffic and slow commuting times - increase the marginal cost of reaching the office and make the prospect of staying at home more attractive. The authors note that on average, family CEOs are wealthier and have more job security than their professional manager counterparts; this may explain their greater propensity to stay home on days with challenging commutes.

The authors conclude that it is difficult to draw any causal inference from the positive correlation between CEO hours and firm performance. However, they note that the correlation between these two variables translates into a 5.8 percent productivity difference between family and professional CEOs. They write that the evidence further "highlights the importance of how corporate leaders allocate their limited managerial attention... Attention is a scarce resource and particularly so at the top of the organization. The allocation of time reflects the allocation of attention, which in turn depends on the strategic priorities of the CEO."

Under 25yo is high risk. 
Asymptomatic Females should have GC/CT urine yearly (regardless of behavior factors per insurance quality measures)
Syphilis (RPR) in asymptomatic is not routinely screened. 
HIV "should be offered". We generally screen annually or with every new partner. 

Anyone Tx'd for GC, CT or trich should get retested in 3mo. This is test of reinfection in someone presumed high risk rather than test of cure.

By Cali law, Family Pact centers can just give out partner Tx. UCSF et al cannot. (Family Pact is "the green card")

Tell positives to wait 1wk before sex. Good time to talk partner notification. We encourage patients to tell partners {\&} submit to DPH. DPH may be calling partners.

Pap start at 20 now. HPV testing is usually done as a reflex after abnormal Pap. But some places just do HPV first line. 

Women sex with women are treated pretty much the same. 

Straight males = pretty much same as females.

MSM:
At least annual GC/CT. But you've got to sample where the penis is going - oral, urethral or rectal. Urethral can be a tough sell. Barbara milks it and sends that. 

MSM should get RPR on same schedule as HIV. (Syphilis in SF is rare outside of MSM). 

"High risk" get screened q6mo. Many SFGH/UCSF folks assume our whole population is high risk. 

IV drug users should get hepatitis screening too. 

HSV:
We generally don't screen. If someone has a lesion, you pretty much need to scrape it till bleeds to get sample. If someone is bothered by active lesions -> suppressive Tx. 

Trich:
Strawberry cervix, high vaginal pH}

journal = {National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series},
year = {2013},
volume = {No. 19645},
annote = {Employers have long used performance pay and managerial controls as ways to boost employee productivity while also trying to avoid shirking and other problematic behavior (moral hazard) of workers. Reducing Moral Hazard in Employment Relationships: Experimental Evidence on Managerial Control and Performance Pay (NBER Working Paper No. 19645), by Kirabo Jackson and Henry Schneider, reports the findings from a field experiment that compared managerial controls and performance pay at an auto repair firm. The authors find that carefully crafted and monitored managerial controls over mechanics led to a 20 
percent increase in revenue. The results also suggest that a balanced combination of managerial controls and performance pay had the greatest effect in raising productivity and reducing moral hazard.

The authors explain that performance pay has often received attention from employers, public policymakers, and economists as a means of providing incentives to improve employee performance and behavior. Most Fortune 1000 
companies use some form of performance pay to compensate employees and there are increasing calls to adopt performance pay at schools and hospitals. But previous studies have shown that performance pay alone does not always generate the hoped-for outcomes if firms don't effectively observe and supervise workers. This study explores whether managerial controls and performance pay can complement each other in boosting productivity and reducing undesirable worker actions.

The authors worked with a U.S. auto repair chain to design a field experiment with 11 shops in one metropolitan area. The firm provided data on all customers, cars, repairs, and employee pay and hours, and other data covering the 2003-13 period. The authors and management then developed a comprehensive checklist of items on a car that mechanics were required to inspect to determine what repairs might be needed, even if a car was brought in for only an oil change or another simple procedure. Managers closely monitored mechanics to make sure the checklist inspections were handled properly, and the final checklists were routinely collected and maintained by the firm. Some of these same mechanics, many of whom were already compensated by a combination of base pay and commissions, also received commission increases, and the authors tested to see if that led to a higher invoice count and different behavior.

There was an increase in the amount of added repairs and revenue by mechanics under both regimes. The pre-repair checklist inspections led to a 20 percent increase in revenue, a mean increase of $42 per car visit, while a 1 percentage point boost in commission pay for the mechanic led to a mean $29 increase per visit. The managerial-control effect was equivalent to that of a 10 percent increase in the commission rate, suggesting that managerial controls are viable 
alternatives to performance pay in raising employee productivity and reducing moral hazard. The effect of adopting managerial controls was larger among mechanics who received higher commission rates than among those with lower 
rates, indicating that managerial controls and performance pay complement each other. 

While managerial controls led to increased revenue attributable to more repairs conducted on cars and more work performed per week, mechanics who received boosts in their commission rates often increased revenue to the firm by substituting higher-revenue repairs for lower-revenue ones, without a corresponding increase in work hours or in the number of repairs conducted. The authors raise the possibility that this shift reflected mechanics exploiting 
their knowledge and informational advantage relative to customers and was not in the customers' best interest.

...Promise Academy students display some evidence of lifestyle changes: a decline in the rate of teen pregnancy for female students and in the rate of incarceration for males.

A number of recent studies have shown that high-performing charter schools increase test scores for many urban students, but there is relatively little evidence on whether this translates into changes in other dimensions of human capital acquisition such as college enrollment, reduction in the incidence of risky behavior, and improved health.

In The Medium-Term Impacts of High-Achieving Charter Schools on Non-Test Score Outcomes (NBER Working Paper No. 19581), authors Will Dobbie and Roland Fryer, Jr. analyze survey data from hundreds of students who applied to the Promise Academy, a charter middle school in the Harlem Children's Zone in New York City. They find that students who had the opportunity to attend this school not only scored higher on tests but were also more likely to enroll in college. Moreover, Promise Academy students display some evidence of lifestyle changes: a decline in the rate of teen pregnancy for female students and in the rate of incarceration for males. However, for a range of other health-related behaviors there were no apparent changes.

The authors recognize that charter schools are heterogeneous and that many charter schools are no more effective at improving test scores than traditional public schools. But some studies show that higher-quality charter schools - those with extended school days and school years, aggressive recruitment of high-quality teachers, intense data-driven monitoring of student progress, and group tutoring - do achieve higher test scores. Promise Academy is a charter institution with all these attributes and with a lottery process for admission, which allows the authors to compare the academic performance and the other behaviors of admission lottery winners and losers. This provides "treatment" and "control" groups of otherwise comparable students.

The authors find that six years after being admitted to Promise Academy, the lottery-winning students scored 0.28 standard deviations higher on national math achievement tests compared to lottery-losing students, and 0.12 standard deviations higher on reading exams. These students were also more than twice as likely to take and pass advanced exams in chemistry, geography, and other subjects. They were 14.1 percentage points more likely to enroll in college and 21.3 percentage points more likely to enroll in a four-year college, a 102 percent increase from the control mean.

The authors find mixed results with regard to "risky behaviors." Female lottery winners were 12.1 percent less likely to report getting pregnant during their teen years, a 71 percent drop from the control group mean. Male students were 4.3 percent less likely to be incarcerated. But Promise Academy lottery winners reported similar drug and alcohol use and criminal behavior as students who were not selected in the admissions lottery. On health-related issues, going to Promise Academy appears to have little impact on the incidence of asthma, obesity, and mental health problems, though lottery winners were more likely to report eating more nutritious foods.

The authors stress that their conclusions are limited to medium-term outcomes of Promise Academy students, and that longer-term consequences cannot yet be evaluated because of the relatively short time span of the research project. The authors conclude that "the cross-sectional correlation between test scores and adult outcomes may understate the true impact of a high quality school, suggesting that high quality schools change more than cognitive ability."

...caps on damages do not seem to affect observable health care quality...

Medical malpractice laws are often promoted as deterrents to poor patient care. In Does Medical Malpractice Law Improve Health Care Quality? (NBER Working Paper No. 19841), Michael Frakes and Anupam Jena explore the relationship between caps on awards of non-economic damages in malpractice lawsuits and a variety of health care quality indicators. They find that although caps on damages do not seem to affect observable health care quality, shifting state malpractice liability standards from the customary practices of physicians in local areas to national standards of care is associated with higher scores on several quality metrics.

The researchers use data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) from 1979 to 2005 along with information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 1987 to 2008 to create quality measures for health care delivery. Their indicators parallel metrics developed by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. They construct a composite inpatient mortality rate measure for each state in each year; this variable averages 8 percent per year. They also develop a measure of avoidable hospitalizations; there appear to be about 1,000 of these per state per year in the NHDS records. They create a proxy variable for the quality of outpatient care based on the prevalence of cancer screening, which varies from 40 to 73 percent across states in their sample. They also construct an indicator for patient safety using a composite obstetric trauma indicator.

To explore how these quality measures respond to the malpractice policy environment, the authors first study how health care quality changes when states adopt caps on malpractice damage awards. They find no substantial effects, a result that is inconsistent with claims that uncapped awards affect physician practice. However, when they investigate how their quality measures respond to changes in state standards for clinical malpractice, in particular the adoption of rules holding physicians to national standards of care, they find important effects. On average, the quality measures in a state converge toward average national rates after that state adopts national standard rules. Eleven states adopted national standards between 1980 and 1988; three states did so between 1992 and 1998. In states where the measured quality of care was high before adopting these standards, the adoption of national standard laws did not appear to be associated with a change in observable quality. However, in initially low-quality states, adopting a national standard of care was associated with an improvement in all of the quality measures. The authors conclude that structural reforms in the way in which malpractice law evaluates physicians may substantially alter health care delivery practices and improve quality.

journal = {National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series},
year = {2013},
volume = {No. 19574},
annote = {When the cost of health insurance for public sector workers rises, is the higher 
charge reflected in higher taxes, in lower wages or other benefits for the 
employees, or in some combination of the two? In Who Pays for Public Employee 
Health Costs? (NBER Working Paper No. 19574) Jeffrey Clemens and David Cutler 
find that about 15 percent of the cost of recent benefit growth was paid by 
school district employees through reductions in wages and salaries. They find 
that in tough economic times, a larger share of the cost increase is borne by 
the workers themselves through cutbacks in other compensation.

One in seven workers is employed by a state or local government. These employers 
spent $70 billion (in 2012 dollars) on health insurance in 2001, and $117 
billion in 2010, for an increase of $130 per capita. In the private sector, 
businesses may pass such costs back to workers in the form of increased cost 
sharing for health insurance, less coverage, lower contributions to employee 
benefits, or smaller wage increases, or they may increase prices for their 
products. But where wages and benefits are covered by union contracts -- as is 
the case for many state and local employees -- the opportunity for shifting costs 
to workers is often limited.

To understand how governments have responded, the authors analyze data on school 
district budgets and the benefit costs associated with their employees over the 
period between 2001 and 2012. They find that benefit-driven increases in 
employee compensation were largely financed by resource transfers from higher 
levels of government, often in the form of transfers for which the states and 
districts had some discretion in reporting. One-third of the relevant dollars, 
for example, are associated with "categorical aid" for students with special 
needs. The analysts conclude that the compensation of school district employees 
tended to rise, on net, by 85 cents for each dollar increase in benefit costs. 

Clemens and Cutler also compare the costs of employee health plans for state 
government employees to the average cost of private employer-provided health 
plans. They conclude that state governments raised premium requirements 
relatively more for more generous plans, which were typically in states with 
prominent public unions, than did private employers. Coupled with a slowdown in 
premium growth, this change suggests that state governments achieved significant 
savings relative to trends in the private sector.

Many policies designed to raise student achievement in the United States focus 
on raising the effort that students devote to their studies, for example by 
offering rewards for achieving prescribed benchmarks. These strategies are based 
on the belief that because the payoffs to education may be too far in the future 
to motivate some students, financial incentives that make the payoffs more 
immediate may be warranted. In Financial Incentives and Educational Investment: 
The Impact of Performance-Based Scholarships on Student Time Use, (NBER Working 
Paper No. 19351), authors Lisa Barrow and Cecilia Rouse test whether and how 
financial incentives change student behavior using survey data from a field 
experiment in California and New York. Overall the results indicate that 
well-designed incentives can induce post-secondary students to increase 
investments in educational attainment. 
In the experiment, students were randomly assigned to treatment and control 
groups where the treatments were incentive payments which varied in length and 
magnitude and were tied to meeting performance, enrollment, and/or attendance 
benchmarks. Students were then asked to fill out a survey including questions 
about time allocated to different activities as well as questions aimed at 
measuring the quality of educational efforts, such as learning strategies, 
academic self-efficacy, and motivation. 
The results suggest that providing post-secondary scholarships with incentives 
to meet specific benchmarks induced students to devote more time to educational 
activities and to increase the quality of the effort directed toward their 
studies. Students also allocated less time to other activities such as work and 
leisure. The incentives did not decrease students' inherent interest in or 
enjoyment of learning, or increase cheating to raise their grades. The results 
also suggest that students who appeared to discount the future the most, such as 
those who dropped out of high school before the twelfth grade, were the most 
responsive to the incentives. Further, the incentives only generated impact 
during semesters of eligibility. 
A puzzle is that larger incentive payments did not seem to induce students to 
increase effort more than smaller incentive payments. The authors speculate that 
this might be because students just need a small prompt to encourage them to put 
more effort into their studies.

Does birth order correlate with student performance, and if so, why? In 
Strategic Parenting, Birth Order and School Performance (NBER Working Paper No. 19542), 
V. Joseph Hotz and Juan Pantano present both empirical and theoretical 
evidence on these questions. They study all children born to the female 
respondents in the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in families of 
two, three, or four children. 

They find that birth order affects perceived academic performance for 10- to 
14-year-olds. On average, mothers with two children were almost 8 percent less 
likely to say that their second child was one of the best in his class. 
Earlier-born children also had higher scores on the Peabody Individual 
Achievement Test and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test at age ten. The effects 
of birth order persisted for second children even when the sample was restricted 
to "intact" families in which children's performance had not been affected by 
divorce or other family disruptions. 

The evidence suggests that earlier-born siblings are more likely to be "subject 
to rules about TV watching and to face more intense parental monitoring 
regarding homework" and that "mothers are more likely to report that they would 
increase the supervision of one of their children in the event that child 
brought home a worse than expected report card when the child in question was 
one of her earlier-born children." 

The authors draw on game-theoretic models that emphasize reputational concerns 
in an attempt to explain the correlation between birth order and children's 
school performance. They conjecture that earlier-born siblings will put forth 
more effort in school and end up performing better because parents are more 
likely to set higher standards for earlier-born children and to impose 
consequences for poor performance. The study concludes that "parental reputation 
dynamics may explain part of the observed birth order effects in school 
performance." }

Most studies of Medicaid focus on the effects of the program on health 
expenditures or health outcomes. In The Impact of Medicaid on Labor Force 
Activity and Program Participation: Evidence from the Oregon Health Insurance 
Experiment (NBER Working Paper No. 19547), authors Katherine Baicker, Amy 
Finkelstein, Jae Song, and Sarah Taubman consider a set of additional effects. 
They focus on how Medicaid coverage affects enrollees' labor market activity and 
their take-up of government benefits such as disability insurance and welfare. 
The authors build on an ongoing study of a 2008 policy change in Oregon in which 
the state initiated a limited expansion of its Medicaid program for low-income, 
uninsured adults, drawing approximately 30,000 names by lottery from a waiting 
list of 90,000. Those selected won the chance to apply for Medicaid and to be 
covered if they met eligibility requirements. The lottery increased enrollment 
in Medicaid by about 25 percent, with virtually no impact on the coverage rate 
for private insurance. 

The authors note that the income ceiling for Medicaid eligibility may discourage 
employment and earnings, and that Medicaid insurance coverage itself may reduce 
the beneficiaries' incentive to seek employment as a way to obtain health 
insurance. If access to Medicaid reduces beneficiaries' earnings, this could in 
turn increase eligibility for, and hence participation in, other means-tested 
programs. It is also possible that participation in Medicaid may increase 
participation in other government programs by increasing awareness of these 
programs or by reducing the transaction costs of applying. These possibilities 
have raised concern that expanding Medicaid would reduce earnings and tax 
revenues, while contributing to additional increases in government spending.

By exploiting the random nature of increased access to Medicaid in Oregon, this 
study is able to provide evidence on the effect of program access that avoids 
many of the usual concerns about non-random selection into government programs. 
The results suggest that expanded Medicaid coverage in Oregon did not affect 
beneficiaries' employment or earnings over the first one to two years. The 
authors note that their results are subject to a margin of error, but they are 
precise enough to rule out either positive or negative employment effects of 
more than a few percentage points. The authors also find that Medicaid coverage 
increases the probability that a household receives food stamps. They find no 
substantial effects on the use of a range of other government programs including 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI), and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). 

These are the latest results from the Oregon Health Insurance Project which uses 
the random assignment associated with the eligibility lottery to study the 
impact of covering low-income, uninsured adults with Medicaid. Other key 
findings from the first one to two years of Medicaid coverage include: 1) 
Medicaid coverage increases health care use including emergency department 
visits, hospital admissions, outpatient visits, prescription drugs, and 
preventive care, as well as self-reported access to care; 2) Medicaid reduces 
exposure to financial risk, including the probability of having unpaid medical 
bills sent to collection agencies, and virtually eliminates the risk of 
catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditures; and 3) Medicaid improves some 
measures of health, specifically self-reported health, and reduces rates of 
depression but has no statistically significant effect on measured physical 
health outcomes such as blood pressure or cholesterol levels. More detail on 
these and other findings can be found on the study's website 
(www.nber.org/oregon).}
